Its a text editor for python beginners. NOT AN IDE

# Reasons why text editors are better than ides for beginners:

-No pylance, pyflakes or whatever which forces them to find their own errors so they don't make bad habits, ie forgetting the "" or tabs or whatever

-A lot less overwhelming for beginners

-No run button which forces them to get familliar with the terminal

-A lot cleaner
